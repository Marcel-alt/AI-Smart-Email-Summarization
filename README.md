# AI-Smart-Email-Summarization
# AI-Powered Smart Email Summarization & Prioritization 🚀
### Automating Email Management Using OpenAI GPT & AWS Cloud

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses **OpenAI GPT-4 and AWS Lambda** to **automatically summarize incoming emails**, prioritize them, and generate action items. It improves email processing efficiency and helps professionals focus on what matters.

## 🎯 Features
+ **Summarizes incoming emails** in 1-2 sentences.  
+  **Categorizes emails into priority levels** (Urgent, Important, Low-Priority).  
+  **Extracts action items** for follow-ups.  
+  **Deployed using AWS Lambda & API Gateway** for a serverless execution.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **OpenAI GPT-4 API** → AI-powered text summarization  
- **AWS Lambda** → Serverless backend processing  
- **Amazon SES (Simple Email Service)** → Fetching and processing emails  
- **AWS API Gateway** → Exposing AI summarization as a REST API  
- **Python (Flask/FastAPI)** → API backend for AI calls  
- **DynamoDB/S3** → Storing processed email insights  

## 🚀 How It Works
1. User sends an email to a pre-configured inbox.  
2. AWS Lambda triggers and processes the email.  
3. OpenAI GPT-4 generates a short summary + priority score.  
4. AI extracts any **action items** (tasks, follow-ups).  
5. The results are **stored in a database** and optionally displayed via API/UI.
